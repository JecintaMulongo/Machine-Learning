High fuel consumption is experienced in \mycorrections{ telecommunication} based stations. As telecommunication base stations require electricity to operate, high fuel consumptions remains a challenge in base stations management as the working capital increases every year. To cope with this problem, we aim to detect anomalies in the recorded data by learning the pattern of the fuel consumed dataset and compare the performance of the four classification techniques on the unseen dataset. In this paper, we show the use of supervised machine learning classification based techniques in detecting anomalies associated with the fuel consumed dataset from TeleInfra\footnote{{\tt http://www.art.cm/en/node/3111}} base station using the generator as a source of power. We made use of machine learning techniques to train the dataset, these include support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP).  We evaluate models performance using K-fold
cross validation and training test split techniques and classification performance metrics were used to evaluate the fitted models. Comparative study of the classifier is done for model selection, and the result of this study shows that MLP has the best performance in the evaluation measured used with a score of $0.96$ in both K-fold cross validation and train test split. In the area under the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curve, the model attained a score of $1.00$ and $0.98$ respectively. Our results also show that the working hours of the generator explains much the classification class.
